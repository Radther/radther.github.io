A meteor shower that meteorologists have been monitoring for the last few weeks shot past earth last night in an amazing display. 

The meteor shower lasted a couple of hours and was surprisingly bright considering the clouds where I was. There were over 30 shards visible, with the main piece being over 22 Kilometers in size. 

Here is some pictures of the event:-
