## The Third Day
Today started with an eccentric programming teacher teaching us some Java. We were given a "Space Invaders" demo to work from to help us learn the basics of OOP (Object-oriented programming). Fortunately I'm already familiar with concepts of OOP, but you probably don't want to hear about all that stuff. 

The next class we had was Spanish and Catalan culture, in which we learn about things from how surnames are formed to the fact that Spain has a lot of virgins. Oh, and people go topless on beaches. 

Unfortunately not much happened then 'til later on in the day, when we decided to goto the pub to watch some football. Not normally my idea of fun but was surprisingly entertaining... Then I decided to ask about offside. 
This is when Harry decided to make use of everything close to him to explain it. This involved glasses and bottles to represent the two teams and an ice cube for a ball. The explanation was well thought out if not a little wet. 

Sorry about the delay in upload, last night ended a bit late and I was very tired.
