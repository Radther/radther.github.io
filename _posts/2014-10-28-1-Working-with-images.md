# Working with images

## The Issue
Looking at this picture, the problem to me seemed to be that carrying the cans of drink put strain on the persons hand. Having carried cans like this before I know that after a couple of minutes the plastic leaves marks in your hand and can hurt a bit.

## The Fix
Answer to this problem should be quite simple. A better handle. The handle should be larger with a larger surface area against the hand, this would alleviate the plastic digging into your hand so much. There is still the problem that the cans need to be carried but at least the experience isnâ€™t a painful one for something that tastes nice.
