**Usability in itself:** This is when the technology is tested in a lab and not in the real world, to see ho usable it is. Testing is done in a controlled environment and measured quantifiably.  

**Usability in life:** This is when technology is tested in the real world. This is used to show problems that wouldn’t arise in lab based testing. 

## How usable is the room control panel
### Usable in itself
To test this I would first look at the tasks the device would be used for, e.g. opening the window. I would then make a note of the minimum number of steps required to complete that task.

I would ask users to attempt the task and see how many “clicks” it takes them and compare it with the optimal way of completing this action. This would show how well the device does a good enough job of explaining its functions.

Another thing I would quantify is the time to complete the task. If the task should only take a couple of seconds but the user spends 30 seconds to find which button they should press first then there is clearly a problem.

### Usable in life
To test this I will need to find some motivation for the user. One way of doing this is sticking them in a hot room and saying “If you want you can open the window, the controls are over there”. This way they have a personal motivation for getting it done otherwise they will be stuck in the heat. 

The same things could then be tested for, the number of clicks, and the time it takes. Unfortunately there are probably things against sticking someone in a hot room…
