## The first day
Depending on who you are, you may or may not know that I am going to Barcelona. Well I'm there. This will be a daily blog on my events here. I'll try to include as much interesting information as possible. So lets begin.

So it all starts with the plane. Fortunately there isn't much to tell here. It all went smoothly and were in Barcelona by 10 Oâ€™clock by UK time. The first thing that is impossible not to notice is the sudden heat, and the lack of a breeze. We were then directed onto the coach which took us from Barcelona to Mataro, the route was next to the sea and oh my god was it *b-e-a-utiful*!

When we finally arrived at our destination we were situated outside of the Tecno Campus (the university we will be studying at). We then had to wait a while before we were taken to our accommodation. I am staying with some of my friends from uni. Should be fun. 

The apartment is quite large and the rooms are spacious enough. The view out of my room is also something to look at. 

Once we were all settled in we decided we needed a McDonald. This involved walking for about 30 minutes in the extreme heat before for finally finding the golden arches; and then we had to order...

Unfortunately my Spanish isn't the best. In fact, it's non-existent. Nick however knew enough to help me order some chicken nuggets, chips and a drink; and man did it taste good. After we had all eaten and built up the courage to step back outside we went on a trek back to the apartment to rest before going to the Mataro parc. The mall of Mataro. Getting there required a lot of waiting for a bus but eventually we made it and had a wonderful drink. 

Me and Harry thought it would be a good idea to look around the mall and see what we could find, and man did we hit gold. We found a large supermarket, with isles and isles of stuff. They had everything from TVs and Computers, to garden furniture and pick'n'mix cereal. It was wonderful and we decided to get a few things before trying to walk home. Which didn't work out so well.

We started making our way down through the town, thinking we were going in the right direction but turned out to be completely lost. We eventually made it to the beach where we walked along side the sea before finally coming to our apartment. Our feet aching and our legs tired, man we were happy to be sitting down.

That has been my day.
