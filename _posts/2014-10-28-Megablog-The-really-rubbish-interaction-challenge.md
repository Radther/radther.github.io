# Megablog - Bus timetable
Most bus stations in Coventry, at least in the city centre, there are electronic bus timetables. These are put in place to help people know when the next bus is set to arrive.

The problem comes when the bus is delayed or late. The timetable doesn’t update so people just sit waiting, hoping that the bus will arrive. After the period when the bus was supposed to arrive, that busses slot on the timetable goes and the next one moves up. To a lot of people this looks like the bus has been canceled when really it’s just delayed.

This could be easily fixed by adding GPS to the busses and updating the timetables in real time as the busses come in.
