## Definitions
### Pervasive computing
1. The idea that technology is moving past the personal computer to devices becoming embedded in the world.
2. The idea that almost everything, from clothes to the human body, will have an chip to connect it to an infinite number of networked devices.

### Ubiquitous computing
1. A concept in computer science that devices will appear anywhere and everywhere.
2. The idea that everything will have technology that can enhance user interaction with it.

### Ambient computing
1. Devices that are aware of human presence and can act based on that information.
2. The idea that technology will be able to personalise itself for you and anticipate your needs.

### Disappearing computing
1. The idea that a piece of technology becomes a part of life so much that it just disappears. You no longer think about it being there.
2. The idea that technology disappears in a physical sense, either by being made smaller or being imbedded into things, such as a interactive wall.


## Differences and Similarities
### Within the term
#### Pervasive computing
The terms are quite similar in what they are stating. It is the idea that computers get put into everything. The one difference is that one of the terms about all the technology being connected to each other.

#### Ubiquitous computing
The first term is very similar to the pervasive computing terms in that it is everywhere.
The second one talks about technology that enhances user interaction. This I feel is more important because technology for the sake of technology could cause more problems then it’s worth.

#### Ambient computing
This one talks about how computers will be aware of humans around them, the first talks about acting based on a users presence, while the second talks about how the computers will attempt to personalise themselves to the individual user and predict what the human wants or is about to do.

#### Disappearing computing
The terms in this case are quite different, the first talks about technology that is still visible but is no longer thought about and just becomes a part of daily life. The second however, talks about technology getting smaller and becoming more imbedded in the world itself, like into walls and surfaces.


### To each other
The first two terms are quite similar to each other, both talking about how computers will be everywhere and will be embedded into everything, the one that stands out however is the second one in ubiquitous which talks about enhancing user interaction.
The second two are quite a bit different. The first talks about how computers will be more aware of people around them and the second talks about how computers are more hidden, these two would work well in tandem though. Computers that are invisible to people but are enhancing there life through personalised awareness.

Overall all these terms work well together and when thought of as a whole they make the future sound really awesome.

## EXTRA
I had a look around the university to find things that could be classified as “pervasive computing”. One example that I found was the screens outside the doors of most of the rooms. 

![Screens outside the doors at university that display information about the room](/Assets/Images/universityroomscreens.jpg/)

These display the room number as well as information about the current class in the room and who is running it. This information can be very helpful in knowing how long the rooms are booked for and when the next lesson in there will start.
